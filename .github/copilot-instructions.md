# STUI - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

**STUI** (pronounced "Stewie") is a **Sonar Terminal User Interface** — an ncurses-style TUI application built in Go using [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea). It provides a unified interface for installing and managing applications from SonarSoftwareInc's GitHub repositories.

## Target Applications

STUI manages installation of these Sonar tools:

| App | Repo | Install Pattern |
|-----|------|----------------|
| Customer Portal | `SonarSoftwareInc/customer_portal` | `git clone` + `sudo ./install.sh` (Docker-based) |
| Netflow On-Prem | `SonarSoftwareInc/netflow-onprem` | `git clone` + configure `.env` + `sudo ./install.sh` (Docker-based) |
| FreeRADIUS Genie v3 | `SonarSoftwareInc/freeradius_genie-v3` | `git clone` + `./genie` CLI (native, PHP) |
| Poller | `SonarSoftwareInc/poller` | `wget setup.sh` + `sudo ./setup.sh` (native, PHP/composer) |

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go
- **TUI Framework:** [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) (Model-View-Update architecture)
- **Components:** [Bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles) (spinners, lists, text inputs, etc.)
- **Styling:** [Lip Gloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)
- **Distribution:** Single static binary via GoReleaser, installable via `curl | sh`
- **Future:** GraphQL client for Sonar API queries/mutations

## Design Principles

1. **Installer Interface** — Each Sonar app implements a common interface:
   - `PreflightCheck()` — detect OS/version, check root, check dependencies
   - `Configure()` — interactive prompts for `.env` values, API tokens, etc.
   - `Install()` — execute the actual installation steps
   - `Verify()` — confirm installation succeeded

2. **Stream Output** — Shell command output should be streamed into the TUI in real-time so users see progress from underlying install scripts.

3. **Preflight Safety** — Always detect OS, version, and prerequisites before starting installation. Fail fast with clear messages.

4. **Config Wizard** — Prompt for configuration values (Sonar URL, API tokens, domain names) interactively within the TUI rather than requiring manual file edits.

## Coding Standards

- Use `gofmt` / `goimports` for formatting
- Follow standard Go project layout conventions
- Error handling: wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- Use structured types over raw maps
- Keep TUI models focused — one model per screen/view
- Test installer logic independently from TUI rendering

## Comment Standards (MANDATORY)

Every Go source file **must** have thorough, consistent comments. This is non-negotiable.

### File-Level Comments
- Every `.go` file starts with a comment block describing the file's purpose.
- For files that define a package's primary entry point, use the `// Package <name> ...` godoc form.
- For other files in the same package, use `// <filename> implements/contains ...` followed by context (e.g., upstream repo links for installer files).

### Function & Method Comments
- **Every** exported function/method must have a `// FuncName ...` godoc comment.
- **Every** unexported function/method must also have a `//` comment explaining its purpose.
- Comments should describe *what* the function does and *why*, not just restate the name.

### Type & Struct Comments
- Every exported type gets a `// TypeName ...` godoc comment.
- Every struct field gets an inline `//` comment describing its purpose and any constraints (e.g., which app it applies to).

### Constants & Variables
- Every `const` and exported `var` block gets a group comment.
- Individual constants/variables within a block each get their own `//` comment.

### Test File Comments
- Test files get a `// <filename> contains ...` header summarizing what's tested.
- Every `Test*` function gets a `//` comment describing the scenario(s) it covers.
- Test helpers get `//` comments explaining their role.

### Style Rules
- Use concise, imperative voice: `// Validate checks that ...` not `// This method is used to validate ...`
- Keep comments to 1–2 lines for simple functions; use a short paragraph for complex ones.
- Never leave an exported symbol uncommented — `golangci-lint` with `revive` enforces this.
- When adding new code, **always** add comments in the same commit — never defer them.

## Post-Change Workflow (MANDATORY)

After **every** completed todo item, task, or logical unit of change, you **must** run all of the following steps in order before moving on:

1. **Build** — `go build ./...` — Confirm the application compiles cleanly. Fix any errors before proceeding.
2. **Lint** — `golangci-lint run ./...` — Zero issues required. Fix all warnings and errors inline.
3. **Test** — `go test ./... -count=1` — All tests must pass. If a test fails, fix it immediately.
4. **BEADS** — Meticulously maintain issue tracking after each change:
   - `bd update <id> --status in_progress` when starting work on an issue.
   - `bd close <id> --reason "..."` immediately when work is done.
   - `bd create "Title" --description="..." -t <type> -p <priority>` for any new issues, bugs, or follow-up work discovered during implementation.
   - `bd sync` at the end of each session to persist state.

**Do not skip or defer these steps.** Every change must leave the project in a green (compiling, linted, tested) state with BEADS accurately reflecting the current status of all work.

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` for workflow context.

**Quick reference:**
- `bd ready` — Find unblocked work
- `bd create "Title" --type task --priority 2` — Create issue
- `bd close <id>` — Complete work
- `bd sync` — Sync with git (run at session end)

## Important Notes

- Target platform is **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (matching Sonar's supported OS)
- STUI itself should be cross-compilable but installers target Linux
- All Sonar apps require **root/sudo** for installation
- The customer_portal and netflow-onprem use **Docker**; poller and freeradius are native installs
